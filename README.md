# Rare Publishing Platform Notes

Our client, Rare Publishing, needs a new application built for their readers. Currently, readers can submit new articles through the mail and once month Rare sends out a Zine of articles that the publishers liked the most. They've finally decided that the internet is not a fad and want a new way for readers view posts.

The application will give users the ability to submit, update and comment on posts. The posts will also be organized by tags and categories making it easier for the reader to find the posts they are searching for. The app also has functionality specific to the Admin such as activating and deactivating accounts. Additionally, the admin can control the status of each user.
